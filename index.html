                    Hello, I am Rifah Tasfia, currently studying in Slippery Rock
                    University of Pennsylvania. I am doing my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science, 
                    as a student at the Department of Computer Science as well  as pursuing my

                    I came to Slippery Rock as an international undergraduate student after

                        The second project that I have worked on called "Tic-Tac-Toe". Requires user to select a spot between 1 to 9.
                        If the opponent player already took the spot it will ask the user to enter a number again. At the end, the results will
                        tell whether it's a tie or not.

                <p>
                        I performed a team research on a very powerful open-source digital forensics tool 
                        called Sleuth Kit tool. 
                        <br><br>
                        The main idea behind this tool is to demontrate
                        how the use of a sleuth Kit tool can be crucial in digital forensic investigation. Moreover,
                        how the Sleuth Kit recovers deleted files.Throughout this research, I gained valuable hands-on 
                        experience in file system analysis, and I have learned how digital investigators work behind the scenes.
